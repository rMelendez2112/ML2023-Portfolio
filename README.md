<b>Technical Skills</b>
<p>Languages: Python, R, C++</p>
<p>Editors: Google Colab, RStudio, CodeBlocks, Visual Studio Code</p>

<b>Soft Skills</b>
<p>Has successfuly coordinated collaborative team projects</p>
<p>Experienced in project documentation</p>

 <b>Overview</b>
<p>This class wasn't my first brush with machine learning concepts or applications, but it helped solidify the concepts better than if I hadn't enrolled. I first explored ML programs in Google Colab, but this was my first time applying these algorithms and concepts in languages other than Python, namely C++ and R. Concerning future endeavors in Machine Learning, I would like to first try and create personal projects using the concepts and methodologies I've picked up. To be more specific, I want to explore deep learning further to use automation in unique ways. One potential project I have in mind is a web application that generates bass melodies based off a Roland TB-303 style sound with an internal sequencer. I know this is possible because there was a web app I found not to long ago that did the exact same thing.</p>
